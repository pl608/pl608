* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Unity2d game that I havent made a name for yet
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to code in java script and I and relitivly good at HTML/CSS and have coded many simple consonle/tkinter applications in python
* ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all things unity, gimp and html
* âš¡ Fun fact: I hate mushrooms(dull squishy things)

  I have been on computers for a very long time and have been around RPIs for ages(though I never really got to use them). I first started programing in a language for minestorms(a lego robot). Later I learned to make simple python console apps and made a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter. Then I found a new language, Scratch, where I got sucked into minecraft(which i later found on the rpis).https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128407. And then for the past 2 years i have been finding out c++, c#, godot(never actually used but it is installed for later), javascript, html/css, and java
